# Welcome to my writing portfolio!
This repository contains an assortment of documents that I've created in my technical writing career. In each folder, I've included a README file that provides some context for the included work.
The samples included here are from the last 10 years of my career. 
## About me
I initially became a technical writer because I was always that one person in the office who actually liked writing to explain things. I remained a technical writer over the years because I love learning about new technologies, better ways of doing the same old tasks, and helping people successfully use the products they paid for.
### Industry experience
In my writing career, I've worked in several different industries:
- Retail food service
- Health insurance
- Human resources management
- Enterprise web hosting
- Property management
- Software development
In every job, I've made developing industry expertise a priority so I can better understand the customers that my writing will serve.
### What I'm known for
During my tenure at Citrix, I was able to establish myself as a tech-focused writer who dives deeply into a given subject and quickly establishes rapport with technical experts. While I try to learn as much as possible about any technology I'm working with, I obviously can't learn or know everything. When I'm missing key information to complete my understanding, I research and find others who are willing to help me. 
I was also able to develop a reputation as a person who readily embraces change and enjoys being an early adopter, especially when it comes to making the authoring and publishing process more efficient and content-focused.
## Content types
In my work, I've written the following types of content:
- Tutorials
- How-tos
- Conceptual explanations
- Video scripts
- Product UI explainers (such as dialog and field descriptions and tooltips)
